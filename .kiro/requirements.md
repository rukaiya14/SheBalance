# SheBalance - AI-Powered Artisan-as-a-Service Platform
## Requirements Document

## The Problem
**What specific gap are you closing?**

India's women artisans possess extraordinary traditional craft skills but remain trapped in an invisible economy. Despite creating immense value through household labor and artisan work, most earn minimal income due to:

- **Skill Invisibility**: No formal recognition or validation of traditional craft expertise
- **Market Disconnect**: Limited access to quality-conscious buyers willing to pay fair prices  
- **Time Fragmentation**: Household responsibilities prevent consistent income generation
- **Language Barriers**: Digital platforms exclude non-English speakers
- **Pricing Undervaluation**: Artisans undercharge for their work due to lack of market intelligence

## The User
**Who exactly are you building for?**

## The AI Edge
**Why is AI the essential tool for this solution?**
