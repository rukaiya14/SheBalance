# SheBalance - AI-Powered Artisan-as-a-Service Platform
## Requirements Document

## The Problem
**What specific gap are you closing?**

India's women artisans possess extraordinary traditional craft skills but remain trapped in an invisible economy. Despite creating immense value through household labor and artisan work, most earn minimal income due to:

- **Skill Invisibility**: No formal recognition or validation of traditional craft expertise
- **Market Disconnect**: Limited access to quality-conscious buyers willing to pay fair prices  
- **Time Fragmentation**: Household responsibilities prevent consistent income generation
- **Language Barriers**: Digital platforms exclude non-English speakers
- **Pricing Undervaluation**: Artisans undercharge for their work due to lack of market intelligence

**Solution**: The "Invisible Labor" Digital Twin creates a visual representation of an artisan's multi-tasking reality through Labor-Time Visualization (LTV). The AI generates a dynamic "Digital Twin" of the artisan's day, layering her craft hours over her household management.

**Implementation**: In the Urban Buyer's view, instead of just seeing a product, they see a "Labor Aura"—a glowing visualization showing the patience and time (e.g., 40 hours of household management + 12 hours of stitching) that went into that one piece.

**REQ-027**: Multi-Dimensional Labor Visualization
